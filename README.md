**Goal: Create an application that manages student enrollments and balances.**
<br>
The application creates x amount of students in order to create data for the database. The number of students needed to enroll is determined by the user.
<br><br>
Once x amount of student objects are created, the user will then be prompted to enter in the student's information such as:

- first name
- last name
- grade year (4 year institution)

Once the grade year has been determined, each student will then receive a 5-digit unique ID with the first number being the student's grade year.
<br><br>
The user will then be able to input various classes the student is enrolling in. There is no limit to the amount of courses the student can enroll in.
<br><br>
Each course is worth \$500. The user will be able to view the total tuition cost based on the amount of courses they are enrolling in once they are finished enrolling. Once the total tuition cost is determined, the student will then be able to input the amount of money they would like to pay towards their tuition.

**LEARNING: OOP**
The student database application was constructed to better understand the concepts of:

- arrays
- objects
- classes
- constructors
- encapsulation
